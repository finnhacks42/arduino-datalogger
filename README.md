## Parts list

## Circuit 

## Code

### External libraries

### Tempurature sensor

### SD card

### Display

### Put it all together

## Build  the case

## Install & Test

## Analyse and report the data

### Taking a rolling average

### Computing the heat index

### Plot the data

## Take action

There are many things that can keep a room cool - which could be tried instead or in addition to installing air conditioning. For example:
   - external blinds
   - instulation
   - double glazing or retrofitting additional panels over windows
   - ventilation
   - reflective paint on the roof
   - shading over the roof

Which of these approaches could work depends on lots of things, such as; 
   - where the heat is coming from (outside or from the people in the room),
   - if heat is coming in through the windows, walls, roof or from a floor below
   - how hot the room is compared to outdoor temperatures at different times of day

### Some questions to ask
   - what time of day is the room hotest? 
   - is the room cooling down overnight?
   - how quickly does the room warm up?
   - does it suddenly start warming up at particular time (like when the sun starts shining in the windows)?
   - is it hotter when the room is in use than in the holidays?
   - how big is the room?
